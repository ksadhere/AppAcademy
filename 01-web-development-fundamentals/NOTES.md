## Introduction to JavaScript

- Variable Declaration is the process of simply introducing a variable name into the coding environment, without giving it a value.
- Variable Initialization is the process of both declaring and assigning a variable on the same line.
- Any arithmetic including undefined will result in Not-a-Number (NaN).

### Functions

A function declaration is when a function is defined and saved so that we can use it or re-use it later. When we use a declared function, we are calling the function. Calling a function is also known as invoking a function.

A function definition consists of the function keyword, followed by three things:

- The name of the function.
- A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses (( )).
- The code to be run when this function is run, enclosed in curly braces ({ }).

#### The difference between Parameters and Arguments

- Parameters are comma separated variables specified as part of a function's declaration.
- Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked.
